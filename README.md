# Pacman-game
Description: Developed a fully functional Pacman game using Quartus and FPGA technology. This project was carried out in collaboration with Lab 1A in the Electrical Engineering department.

Responsibilities:
Designed and implemented the game logic and graphics using Quartus, an FPGA design software.
Utilized FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) for hardware implementation, ensuring efficient and high-speed performance.
Employed SystemVerilog for verification purposes, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the gameâ€™s functionality.
Conducted thorough testing and debugging to optimize game performance and user experience.

Skills Acquired: Proficiency in FPGA design, Quartus software, hardware-software integration, SystemVerilog verification, and problem-solving in digital system design.


tools:

1.(FPGA) to create a hardware-based Pacman game, allowing for efficient parallel processing and real-time gameplay.

2.Quartus Design: design and optimize the digital circuits essential for the Pacman game. This includes configuring logic elements, implementing state machines, and managing resources for optimal performance.

3.System Verilog Verification: Ensure the reliability and correctness of the game dynamics with System Verilog. Employ advanced verification methodologies to validate collision handling, user input, and the overall game logic.

project Key Features:

1.Bitmap Graphics:- we used bitmaps to draw walls , ghosts , coins , hammer and pacman on the screen.

2.Dynamic Hearts: Introduce an engaging lives system with dynamic hearts. Pacman starts with three hearts, and collisions with green ghosts add an extra heart, up to a maximum of three hearts. Collisions with red ghosts, on the other hand, result in the loss of one heart, gameover if you have zero hearts. 

3.Coin Collection: Devour the challenge of collecting all the coins scattered across the maze to emerge victorious. Each coin brings you closer to completing the level, but beware of the ghosts strategically patrolling to thwart your progress.

4.hammer Collection: The hammer gives you the ability to break walls

5.Interactive Maze Elements: Encounter different wall types within the maze, each with its own unique properties. Some walls disappear after a set number of collisions ( Provided you took the hammer), creating dynamic pathways and adding an extra layer of strategy to the gameplay.
